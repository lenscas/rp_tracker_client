# rp_tracker_client
This is a client for my rp managing API (https://github.com/lenscas/rp_tracker/)

This allows users to easily find intresting Roleplays they can join, make characters for those roleplays and play.

It also makes the lives of GM's easier by easily managing character base stats and modifiers on them, making it easy to manipluate rolls with them and keeping track of the state of battle.

The client and the API however are far from finished at this point and at this point are thus not yet hosted. If you want to play around with it you will need a working instance of the API and a server that can serve html files, this can be the same server that hosts the API.
